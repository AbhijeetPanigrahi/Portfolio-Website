# Portfolio-Website

🌟 Welcome to my first portfolio website! 🌐

## Overview

First Try....! This is my initial attempt at creating a portfolio website using HTML and CSS. While it might not be perfect, it's a significant milestone for me as I delve into the world of web development.

## Features

- **HTML and CSS:** This website is built purely with HTML and CSS to showcase my skills and projects.
- **Simple Yet Effective:** While it's a basic design, I've used CSS to enhance the aesthetics and create a visually appealing layout.

## Future Plans

This is just the beginning! I plan to iterate on this design and create a more sophisticated and feature-rich portfolio in the future. Stay tuned for updates!

## Getting Started

Feel free to explore the code in this repository. If you have any suggestions or feedback, I'd love to hear them.
